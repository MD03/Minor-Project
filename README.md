Genetic-Epigenetic Based Hypoglycemia Prediction.
Hypoglycemia is a crucial challenge in diabetes 
management because it is associated with critical risks that 
require accurate predictive methods to reduce severe health 
complications. Most traditional models rely mainly on clinical 
data, thereby neglecting genetic and environmental influences 
that are known to affect hypoglycemia risk. The present study 
proposes a machine learning-based predictive model that 
combines genetic, epigenetic, and clinical data for better 
prediction accuracy of hypoglycemia risk and personalization of 
diabetes treatment strategies. Experimental results showed 
improved accuracy and ROC-AUC values, which indicate the 
great potential of this integrated approach toward predictive 
healthcare.
